To determine a risk analysis, we have set up a list about commercial challenges, in \ref{CommercialChallenges}. We have reached agreement on which challenges were the biggest in our project. We have found 23 different, but just have elaborated a few below.

\subsubsection{Gaining market share}
With these strong competitors, we can identify in the market, it can be very difficult, to a small developer team to make the impact in the market with lots of competition. Companies like BrunnRasmmusen, Lauritz.com and DBA are all well-known actors on the market. They have gained a lot of experience and market knowledge over the last decade. We are full aware of the market, and the market entry barriers. With the business models, analysis of the market and the researched market environment, we have the tools to break through the market entry barriers. If we don't manage to do that, the consequences of this challenge would be extremely high.

\subsubsection{Deadlock}
We have a consequence for this project, if we don't handle deadlocks. If there isn't both sellers and buyers from the beginning, there are no market and no activity. In some way, we have to attract both parties before applications launch. With the purpose of aiming a essential synergy, for making this concept works.
