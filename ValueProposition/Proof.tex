The primary evidence substantiating the value proposition of Artion, is the success of the existing platforms, from which we combine various fragments. The three major concepts we combine are as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item DBA: Quick and easy to create advertisements (short time to market)
    \item Lauritz.com: Consistent presentation of auctions and 7 days before expiration
    \item Instagram: User profiles with infinite scrolling 
\end{enumerate}
These are three well-established concepts, that has proven to be popular over many years. We consider the success of these concepts as the evidence substantiating the value proposition of Artion. We combine these concepts in order to meet the latent needs of consumers, who make up for a gap in the market, which is elaborated in chapter \ref{Market}.
