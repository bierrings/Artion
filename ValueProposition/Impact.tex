We think that to many potential profitable paintings at DBA among other platforms are disappearing in the abundance of products. Currently at DBA in the category "Paintings" we find almost 13.500 advertisements\footnote{https://www.dba.dk/til-boligen/kunst-og-antikviteter/malerier/}. Most of these advertisements does not get any attention and ends up being lost in the crowd. Our application aims to bring them into the light, which it does in three ways; frame recognising camera, simplicity and a time frame of seven days.\\

The majority of the advertisements for paintings at DBA have really bad pictures, which results in less attention. The frame recognising camera feature in our app ensures the picture of a giving painting is perfectly scaled and hereby presented in the best possible way. Another issue at DBA is that it doesn't by default sort the products by the expiration date, meaning the old and "bad" advertisements gets a bad location. \\

Artion benefits the market by providing a platform that makes it easy and quick to create advertisements with consistent and perfectly scaled pictures, ensuring equal spotlight for all advertisements by always sorting by expiration date and time.
