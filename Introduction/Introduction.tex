%The Danes are one of the countries in the world that are most creative and where art plays a greater role\footnote{ \url{http://www.businessinsider.com/most-creative-countries-in-the-world-2011-10?r=US&IR=T&IR=T#4-denmark-13}}. Together with the many art museums that are located widely around the Danish country map, the framework is just as set for Denmark and the cultural freedom\footnote{ \url{http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/danmark/museer/danmarks-mest-besoegte-kunstmuseer}}.

%We want to support the cultural direction we move towards, and create Denmark's first online platform, which deals exclusively with paintings. The idea of creating a platform, where seller and buyer can meet, and where a transaction without any step between are necessary. We are skipping the step, valuation, to a brandnew perspective, where painting has no limit. 
%We would like you, to present, Artion. Artion is a platform, custom-made for creating advertisement of paintings. The camera can easily recognise the picture of the painting, where the function of the camera has been improved. The smart camera is taking the frame of the painting, as the standard of any taking picture on the application. It optimising the picture from the frame, and creating a super sharp picture, ready for upload at our platform.
%The pricing is a fixed object. All auctions begin with the price of 100 DKK.  For any giving bid, there are taking place, the price will increase with the amount of 25DKK. 
%The way we are making money at this, is the take a 20DKK part, of any giving auctions.
