Task focused interface sets the framework for interaction between the user and developer. The intention of the developer is to create a list of tasks that the user has to accomplish. It can both indicate, there should be changes, but also at the same time, if there are elements that are irrelevant to the user specific tasks.

\subsubsection*{List of tasks}
This method is a good opportunity to get in touch with our targeted users. We have created a specified list of user tasks, for this analyse of our app, and its functionality, elements and interface. The main task is to create an auction. The way of creating this, is described in the section before. After an indented user tests, they could have set some more features, they would like to have. In that way, it could develop with the user, and not for the user. 
We think, that the task is specific to the app construction and design. This describe the predefined objective that we have set up from beginning.

\subsubsection*{Layout \& transparent}
We have chosen to use a gallery layout for our application. The grid of two columns, that shows the auctions down through the whole platform, was the main idea for the design. 
Finally, in this analysis, the applications controls unnecessary elements. Together with transparency, we take this into account by using React Native as the coding program. The final purpose is, to make the most simple app possible.
