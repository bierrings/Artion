\subsubsection{Getting in touch with the users}

We want to ensure Artion meets the expectations of potential users. If Artion dont manage to meet the expectations, the consumers might reject using the application. In order to meet the users expectations, we intend to initiate a walk-through process in cooperation with potential users. The purpose of a walk-through, is to conduct a list of requirements in terms of meeting their expectations. The first step in the walk-through is to present the log-in interface for the users. From here the users can access the homepage, which contains the grid of auctions (described in section \ref{DisplayOfAuctions}). Screen shots of the vertical prototype are shown in appendix \ref{AppScreenshots}.\\
\forceindent One of the value-adding activities is the creation of auctions, which is presented by the vertical prototype. When a user creates an auction, he have to press the camera icon in the lower right corner, which opens the frame recognising camera. Once the picture is taken, he must type in the information associated with the painting. Finally, the auction is ready for publishing. The steps of creating an auction are illustrated in appendix \ref{TaskFocusedInterface}\\
\forceindent The output we expect from this process, is a discussion resulting in inputs from the users. 

\subsubsection{Comparison}

We have tested a number of other similar applications among the study group. These tests were intended to clarify the level of time to market and ease of use, when using the competitors platforms to create advertisements. From this process we can conclude, that the platforms provided by the competitors varies a lot, in terms of time to market and ease of use. 

\subsubsection{Learning from user tasks}

With the application we leverage on conceptual models from other applications. The purpose is to support what is considered as general user habbts\footnote{\url{https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review}}. We believe that the process of creating auctions in Artion is very intuitive, as we have simplified the process even more compared to the competitors.
