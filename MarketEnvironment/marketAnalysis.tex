The competition for auctions in the Danish market is widely different. There are from the major national auctions, to the small locals. Our idea focuses on paintings and being able to sell it online.
When we look at the major competitors in the market, we see companies like Lauritz.com and Brunn Rasmussen. Here the auctions take place only after an assessment of the individual products has taken place. The much more accessible company is DBA. Here it costs you nothing to create an ad and you hit a large segment of any buyers. However, you set a fixed price, but others have the opportunity to bid more or less than that.
We have conducted a market analysis based on earnings before tax, in order to categorise and rank our direct competitors in the market.
As we can see in annex X, where we have set up a table, with our competitors and ourselves, it can be highlighted that we certainly have a role to play in the Danish market.
With a calculation of the profit for the year at 304K DKK. we can determine that we earn more than 3 of our 4 competitors. There may be some investment reasons why the 2 competitors create a deficit in the current financial year.
