Following sections will explain the activities we consider adding most value. The complete range of activities for respectively the seller and the buyer is illustrated as service blueprints in appendix \ref{ServiceBlueprint}. The key innovative feature of the application is the combination of the following three activities. The 4th value-adding activity is the community, which is elaborated in the business model, section \ref{Community}.
\section{Display of auctions}
\label{DisplayOfAuctions}
The first step in figure \ref{ServiceBlueprintBuyer} is the customer opening the application. This action performed by the user initiates the application to expose a list of auctions. This list is presented as a grid showing large consistent pictures of the various paintings, including date and time of expiration and price. The frame recognising camera feature ensures a consistent presentation of all pictures in the grid. The grid is divided into two columns and has infinite scroll. The grid displaying all auctions in the application is illustrated in figure \ref{AuctionsGrid}.
\section{Easy and short time to market}
The second step in figure \ref{ServiceBlueprintSeller} is the seller pressing the + (create advertisement) button. This action performed by the seller initiates the application to open the frame recognising camera. Once the picture is taken, the seller has to provide the information associated with the painting, and then the auction is ready for publishing. The process of creating an auction is illustrated in figure \ref{CreateAuction}. 
\section{Safe transactions}
When an auction has ended, the buyer has to pay the hammer price by using the integrated payment module. The payment is then locked in the system and only proceeds to the seller when both parties have confirmed the hand-over by using the confirmation interface, provided by the application. The confirmation interface is illustrated in the horizontal prototype in appendix \ref{HorizontalPrototype}.
